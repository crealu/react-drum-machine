# react-drum-machine
A Drum Machine built using React and configured with Webpack.

## About
A small drum machine that plays an audio file when the user clicks on a drum pad or presses the drum pad's respective key. The pad sound is displayed is then displayed in a small box when the user clicks or presses a key. This repository contains a webpack configuration file that works locally on Windows. In an attempt to explain some of the configuration code, I added a duplicate configuration file called webpackConfigExplained.js.

## Room for improvement
It would be neat to link this to a Node.js backend and enable users to upload their own audio files then assign them to the pads that they want.

A volume knob for each pad and a volume gauge for the whole drum machine could be useful.

My understanding of the webpack configuration is still growing so the explanations are a littel rough.

Visual response to the pressing of pad keys or sounds made.
